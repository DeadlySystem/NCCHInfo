# NCCHInfo

This is a C# port of the ncchinfo_gen.py script from https://github.com/archshift/Decrypt9/tree/master/scripts by archshift. It was created to avoid the need for a Phyton installation. A pre-compiled version can be found in the bin/Release folder:

https://github.com/DeadlySystem/NCCHInfo/tree/master/NCCHInfo/bin/Release

Compiled with Visual Studio 2013. You will need the .NET framework to run it (probably already installed on your machine).

# Usage

Usage is essentially identical to the original script. Just specify your files in the command line (wildcards supported) or drag & drop them onto the executable.

    ncchinfo *.3ds
